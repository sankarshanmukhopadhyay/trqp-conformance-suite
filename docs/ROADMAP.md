- In progress: CI publishes evidence bundles as build artifacts

## 2026 Q2: Deterministic replay and state models

- Planned: state snapshot verification models (fixture ID, snapshot hash, signed snapshot)

## 2026 Q3: Security profiles and plugfests

- Planned: mTLS security profile
- Planned: interoperability plugfest mode and matrix generation

## 2026 Q4: Performance and operational readiness
