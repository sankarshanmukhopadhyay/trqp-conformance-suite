# TEMPLATE — Traceability matrix (not normative)

This is a **template** intended to be copied and completed by implementers.

# Traceability

This repository ships a ready-to-use traceability **template**.

- Template: `docs/templates/traceability-template.md`

Use the template to record how your implementation meets requirements and which evidence artifacts back each claim.

**Note:** Assurance Level (AL) semantics are defined canonically in the TRQP Assurance Hub; this repository consumes those semantics and does not redefine them.
