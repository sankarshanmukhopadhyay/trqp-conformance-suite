# TRQP Conformance (Proposed)

This is PR-ready text to introduce a conformance approach for TRQP:

- Profile-based conformance
- Assertion-based testing
- Evidence-first reporting
- Deterministic verdict model

Implementations MAY claim conformance to one or more profiles (Baseline, Enterprise, High-Assurance).

High-Assurance conformance claims MUST include a state reference when responses depend on registry state.
