# Release Notes — v0.4.1

This release improves auditability and cross-repo consistency by explicitly pinning AL semantics to the canonical source and cleaning up template usage.

## Highlights
- Adds `al-contract.json` to pin AL semantics to the TRQP Assurance Hub definitions.
- Moves traceability fill-in content into `docs/templates/traceability-template.md` and replaces `docs/traceability.md` with clear usage guidance.
- Adds VERSION and changelog structure aligned to release tagging.

## Upgrade notes
- Implementers should use the traceability template as the starting point for evidence capture.
